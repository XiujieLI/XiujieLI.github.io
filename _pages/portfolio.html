<strong> Research Experiecne </strong>
<p> </p>
In my doctoral studies, I work to investigate <strong> airborne transmission in short-term events and atomization mechanisms of medical procedures </strong> through particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The findings can give policymakers insights into developing targeted mitigation measures and reducing the cross-infection risks. </p>

        I would like to say, <span style="color:red">Institute Fallow Time!</span> The initial idea came up during the COVID-19 pandemic when routine dental service was suspended. By investigating the atomization and transmission mechanisms of dental aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), we now can evaluate the recommended precautionary measures in dental clinics. In addition, to make the story more complete, we also measured the airborne lifetime and escaped rates of suspended particles. The results are quite critical, we significantly recommend to <strong>institute the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721004169">Fallow time</a> (FT) between dental patients' appointments</strong>. <strong>The FT is dictated when the number of suspended particles drops to the level that the next patient can safely enter after AGPs</strong>. Now, we are working on more applications to reduce the required FT by considering different evnrionmental conditions and the cooperation of mitigation measures, like the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321006260">high-volume evacuation</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362839719_The_airborne_lifetime_and_spatial-temporal_distribution_of_emitted_droplets_in_dental_procedures">air purifiers</a>.

        Numerous short-term exposure events in public spaces were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, and <strong>the cross-transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is reported to occur even in <span style="color:red">15 seconds</span></strong>. In the project, we aim to investigate the dynamics of airborne transmission in short-term events when a steady state is not reached before the end of the events. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12273-022-0917-9"> Large-eddy simulation (LES)</a> is employed in this study. The results are quite encouraging, <strong> exposure index in short-term events constantly varies over time, especially within the first 1/ACH (air changes per hour) hour of exposure between occupants in close proximity.</strong> Direct airborne transmission is observed with significant randomness, discreteness, localization, and high-risk characteristics. After decoupling analysis of two airborne transmission routes, direct airborne transmission is <strong><span style="color:red">the predominated route in short-term events</span></strong>. The general dilution ventilation has a relatively limited efficiency in mitigating the risk of direct airborne transmission, but determines largely the <strong>occurrence time of the indirect one</strong>.

        This project aims to <strong>design an active daylight harvesting system for building</strong>. Both the numerical simulation and field experiment are employed to assess the performance of daylight systems in building energy consumption and thermal comfort. After retrofiting building using our system, the effective lighting time is more than  doubled  than before. </p>
