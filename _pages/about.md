Currently, I am a Research Fellow in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/beee/"> the Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (BEEE) </a> for the PolyU Matching Fellowship.  I received the Ph.D. degree in August 2023 at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working with Prof. <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/beee/people/academic-staff/professor-mak-cheuk-ming/"> Mak Cheuk Ming </a>. My current study is dedicated to Indoor Air Quality, Building Ventilation, Human Microenvironment, CFD, etc. Before that, I did my Master degree at the School of Environment and Energy, <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>.&nbsp; 

Xiujie’s PhD research examines Nosocomial infections in medical healthcare facilities. His PhD research project <strong>“Atomization and Propagation of Dental Droplets, Emission and Exposure in Medical Surgery Environments”</strong> was awarded the OSH Best Project in 2023 by the OSHC (Hong Kong Occupational Safety & Health Council). He was awarded the Buildings International Journal 2025 Travel Award, and only two junior scientists in the global architecture area were granted in 2025. He actively participates in international professional organizations, including ASHRAE and ISIAQ. Through collaboration with the government, public health agencies, health institutes, universities, and industry partners, we are seeking every possibility to combat this global indoor air crisis.
